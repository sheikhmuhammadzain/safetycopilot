Contributory causes are as following. SIC did not use work permit clause “multiple jobs on same equipment” - could have helped assess the residual hazards and remedial actions required to counter those hazards. Use of SIMOP (simultaneous operation – multiple jobs on single equipment and associated hazards) technique is also not part of any procedure. SIC did not have detailed discussion on agitator PM job with machinery resource resulting in absence of clarity on the job and subsequent issuance of vessel entry permit while agitator PM was in-progress. Deputing two area engineers on single equipment is a bad practice and it resulted in compromised 2nd line of defence in this incident because nobody questioned vessel entry authorization while agitator PM job was in-progress. PM permits are usually written with generic description of job (e.g. PM of agitator) instead of mentioning details of jobs (e.g. alignment, manual rotation, oil draining and filling etc.). to document clarity of SIC as well as executor.

            "It was observed that maintenance KPIs have improved since previous visit, but do not adequately show site management current risk position when compared to best-in-class performance. Survey team was unable to easily see number of overdue SCD PMs, CMs, on-hold items and open notifications which are not yet work orders. The risk is that site management cannot effectively be aware if the current risk level changes, or if today’s risk level is acceptable. This may lead to under resourcing of this critical department and subsequent losses occurring. ; It was observed that permits: Are currently stored outside, not immediately accessible at the work-front or the CCR. Permits are not cross referenced to an isolation diagram. The risk is that: Workers are not able to easily refer to the permit during the task. CCR/ERT is not able to quickly understand impact of operational change or incident on active permits. Workers using a permit may not be clear on energy isolation in-place and will be unable to verify current isolation standard vs. requirement. For example, losses have occurred due to wrong flanges being broken. Permit management was a key factor in the Piper Alpha disaster (to this day, the largest PD loss in history). For complex isolations, there may be multiple work fronts which need to be closed prior to re-isolation. Cross referencing is essential for operations to confirm suitability to re-energize system.; It was observed that on the A-300 Furnace isolation plan, a spool removal was not captured on the isolation plan. In addition, the operations team had removed a spool, which was marked as a blind location on the isolation plan. The risk is that an error could be made when returning the isolated system back into operations, due to the isolation plan not reflecting the actual status of the system and the isolations in place. This risk increases with more complex isolation plans where the plan does not reflect the status in the field. This could lead to a LOPC event during re-energization of the system and a potential fire / explosion – ignition of a gas leak is very likely for furnace area LOPC. ; It was observed that there is currently a utility pump running, feeding into the firewater circuit for non-emergency use process water on site. Site shared that this was acceptable via current practices as the firewater pumps are not being used, despite excess capacity of the F/W main being used. The risk is that the additional hydraulic constraint on the system reduces the maximum attainable flow through the firewater system. In the event of a fire scenario, it is unlikely that process water use will be stopped as priority will be on emergency response. However, the maximum use case may not be possible, impacting firefighting effectiveness and exacerbating the loss. ; It was observed that, the site permit audits did not highlight items identified in 23.02 and 23.03. Given that only a single permit was reviewed during the survey and gaps vs. best-in-class performance were found it suggests that the site auditing system should be routinely finding gaps and driving improvements. However, it was communicated that there were no permit audit findings of note in 2022. The risk is that the site does not organically improve the permit standards above the site current position. An effective auditing system should drive continuous improvement towards best-in-class performance. ",

            "It is recommended to: Enhance the Maintenance KPIs to cover the following items. And consider addition of functionality allowing management to track long term trends. Typical implementation is a 12-month rolling average trend of the KPI. Number of open notifications (divide by criticality if this number is >1000). Number of overdue CMs. Number of on-hold items. Number of overdue safety critical devices. ; It is recommended to: Ensure that permits are available in all locations where required. Typically, this is done in industry by producing copies in triplicate. With a copy being stored at the permit issuing location (typically indoors), a copy at the work-front and a copy available at the CCR. When there are changes made to a live permit all copies are collected together and updated so all copies remain accurate. Ensure that isolation diagrams remain accessible with relevant permits. Modify the permit and isolation plan templates and implement a system for cross-referencing such that all permits requiring an isolation plan clearly refer to the specific isolation plan.; It is recommended to: Immediately rectify active isolation plan to capture current field scenario. Deliver training to reinforce the standard that the isolation plan must reflect current scenario. In the event of any modification being deemed necessary to the isolation plan, no permits must be issued (and any live permits cancelled) until the isolation plan has been updated to reflect the change. The isolation plan is a critical aspect of the safe control of work. Audit additional permits involving isolation plans to ensure learning is captured and good practice is being followed. ; It is recommended to: Verify the hydraulic capacity of the F/W system whilst process water is being used. This could be done by performing a full flow test as per NFPA standards, whilst simultaneously performing a maximum use flow for nonemergency fire water. This would then confirm that the site is able to respond to a worst-case scenario fire with the current fire water system in operation. Develop/provide evidence of a formal system to track when flushing is in progress using any part of the fire water system. ; It is recommended to: Develop a system to audit permits against industry best practice, rather than against site requirement. The Marsh Position Paper on Process Isolations provides guidance here. Develop an auditing program which targets high risk work, sites in industry have found success by reducing the total number of audits but using the resource to complete more in-depth audits of high-risk permits (e.g., in depth and targeted audit of 5% of permits can drive improvements). Audits should look at both the effectiveness of the paperwork as well as in-field implementation. Successful improvements in the audit process would show an increase in number of findings.",
            "• During the transition phase towards a new data management system the existing databases must be fully maintained until they are successfully retired and archived, after the new system is alive. • Confirm the total number of piping lines below MAWT or with remnant life less than 1 year. • Ensure that all scenarios of remnant life below 2 years (or other, as defined by Engro) have a clear and auditable strategy on the master line database record. Note: Transition to electronic integrated software will greatly assist in this regard. • Update the Piping Inspection Manual (and any other pertinent procedures) to ensure the actions are clearly defined for any equipment remnant life below 2 years (or other, as defined by Engro). Typically options include: – Conduct a fitness-for-service assessment (considerations made for pressure retention and structural thicknesses) in accordance with API 579. – Install a temporary repair (e.g. composite wrap or clamp, depending on degradation rate) with a defined life and repair plan. – Isolate the line from service until repaired.; It is recommended to: • Continue work to eliminate the ‘lines that have not yet been inspected’, with priority basis on remaining Class 2 lines across the facility.; It is recommended to: • Ensure that there is a clear strategy for inspection for pressure vessel bridles and ancillary (“trim”) piping where installed on pressure vessels. Marsh recommend this is covered under the vessel inspection routine with these raised as specific ‘components’ in absence of any particular line number.; It is recommended to: • Develop a suite of IOWs as per API 584, for critical systems of the plant. • Identify IOWs as part of the RBI process. • Assign criticality and acceptable deviation durations. • Implement",

          "Finding": "It was observed that maintenance KPIs have improved since previous visit, but do not adequately show site management current risk position when compared to best-in-class performance. Survey team was unable to easily see number of overdue SCD PMs, CMs, on-hold items and open notifications which are not yet work orders. The risk is that site management cannot effectively be aware if the current risk level changes, or if today’s risk level is acceptable. This may lead to under resourcing of this critical department and subsequent losses occurring. ; It was observed that permits: Are currently stored outside, not immediately accessible at the work-front or the CCR. Permits are not cross referenced to an isolation diagram. The risk is that: Workers are not able to easily refer to the permit during the task. CCR/ERT is not able to quickly understand impact of operational change or incident on active permits. Workers using a permit may not be clear on energy isolation in-place and will be unable to verify current isolation standard vs. requirement. For example, losses have occurred due to wrong flanges being broken. Permit management was a key factor in the Piper Alpha disaster (to this day, the largest PD loss in history). For complex isolations, there may be multiple work fronts which need to be closed prior to re-isolation. Cross referencing is essential for operations to confirm suitability to re-energize system.; It was observed that on the A-300 Furnace isolation plan, a spool removal was not captured on the isolation plan. In addition, the operations team had removed a spool, which was marked as a blind location on the isolation plan. The risk is that an error could be made when returning the isolated system back into operations, due to the isolation plan not reflecting the actual status of the system and the isolations in place. This risk increases with more complex isolation plans where the plan does not reflect the status in the field. This could lead to a LOPC event during re-energization of the system and a potential fire / explosion – ignition of a gas leak is very likely for furnace area LOPC. ; It was observed that there is currently a utility pump running, feeding into the firewater circuit for non-emergency use process water on site. Site shared that this was acceptable via current practices as the firewater pumps are not being used, despite excess capacity of the F/W main being used. The risk is that the additional hydraulic constraint on the system reduces the maximum attainable flow through the firewater system. In the event of a fire scenario, it is unlikely that process water use will be stopped as priority will be on emergency response. However, the maximum use case may not be possible, impacting firefighting effectiveness and exacerbating the loss. ; It was observed that, the site permit audits did not highlight items identified in 23.02 and 23.03. Given that only a single permit was reviewed during the survey and gaps vs. best-in-class performance were found it suggests that the site auditing system should be routinely finding gaps and driving improvements. However, it was communicated that there were no permit audit findings of note in 2022. The risk is that the site does not organically improve the permit standards above the site current position. An effective auditing system should drive continuous improvement towards best-in-class performance. ",

          "Action Item Description": "It is recommended to: Enhance the Maintenance KPIs to cover the following items. And consider addition of functionality allowing management to track long term trends. Typical implementation is a 12-month rolling average trend of the KPI. Number of open notifications (divide by criticality if this number is >1000). Number of overdue CMs. Number of on-hold items. Number of overdue safety critical devices. ; It is recommended to: Ensure that permits are available in all locations where required. Typically, this is done in industry by producing copies in triplicate. With a copy being stored at the permit issuing location (typically indoors), a copy at the work-front and a copy available at the CCR. When there are changes made to a live permit all copies are collected together and updated so all copies remain accurate. Ensure that isolation diagrams remain accessible with relevant permits. Modify the permit and isolation plan templates and implement a system for cross-referencing such that all permits requiring an isolation plan clearly refer to the specific isolation plan.; It is recommended to: Immediately rectify active isolation plan to capture current field scenario. Deliver training to reinforce the standard that the isolation plan must reflect current scenario. In the event of any modification being deemed necessary to the isolation plan, no permits must be issued (and any live permits cancelled) until the isolation plan has been updated to reflect the change. The isolation plan is a critical aspect of the safe control of work. Audit additional permits involving isolation plans to ensure learning is captured and good practice is being followed. ; It is recommended to: Verify the hydraulic capacity of the F/W system whilst process water is being used. This could be done by performing a full flow test as per NFPA standards, whilst simultaneously performing a maximum use flow for nonemergency fire water. This would then confirm that the site is able to respond to a worst-case scenario fire with the current fire water system in operation. Develop/provide evidence of a formal system to track when flushing is in progress using any part of the fire water system. ; It is recommended to: Develop a system to audit permits against industry best practice, rather than against site requirement. The Marsh Position Paper on Process Isolations provides guidance here. Develop an auditing program which targets high risk work, sites in industry have found success by reducing the total number of audits but using the resource to complete more in-depth audits of high-risk permits (e.g., in depth and targeted audit of 5% of permits can drive improvements). Audits should look at both the effectiveness of the paperwork as well as in-field implementation. Successful improvements in the audit process would show an increase in number of findings.",

Given that only a single permit was reviewed during the survey and gaps vs. best-in-class performance were found it suggests that the site auditing system should be routinely finding gaps and driving improvements. However, it was communicated that there were no permit audit findings of note in 2022. The risk is that the site does not organically improve the permit standards above the site current position.

          "Finding": "It was observed that, the site permit audits did not highlight items identified in 23.02 and 23.03. Given that only a single permit was reviewed during the survey and gaps vs. best-in-class performance were found it suggests that the site auditing system should be routinely finding gaps and driving improvements. However, it was communicated that there were no permit audit findings of note in 2022. The risk is that the site does not organically improve the permit standards above the site current position. An effective auditing system should drive continuous improvement towards best-in-class performance. ",

Site shared that this was acceptable via current practices as the firewater pumps are not being used, despite excess capacity of the F/W main being used. The risk is that the additional hydraulic constraint on the system reduces the maximum attainable flow through the firewater system. In the event of a fire scenario, it is unlikely that process water use will be stopped as priority will be on emergency response. However, the maximum use case may not be possible, impacting firefighting effectiveness and exacerbating the loss. ",
