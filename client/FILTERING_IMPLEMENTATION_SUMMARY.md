# Analytics Filtering Implementation - Overview Page

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### What Was Implemented

A comprehensive filtering system has been added to the **Overview page** (`src/pages/Overview.tsx`) that integrates all 13 backend filter parameters with the existing analytics charts.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Filter UI Panel**
- **Collapsible filter panel** with toggle button in header
- **Active filter counter** badge showing number of applied filters
- **Clear All** button to reset all filters at once
- **Responsive grid layout** (1-4 columns based on screen size)

### 2. **13 Filter Types**

| Filter | Type | Component | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Start Date** | Date | Input (date) | Filter records from this date |
| **End Date** | Date | Input (date) | Filter records until this date |
| **Departments** | Multi-select | MultiSelect | Filter by multiple departments |
| **Locations** | Multi-select | MultiSelect | Filter by multiple locations |
| **Sublocations** | Multi-select | MultiSelect | Filter by multiple sublocations |
| **Min Severity** | Number | Input (number) | Minimum severity (0-5) |
| **Max Severity** | Number | Input (number) | Maximum severity (0-5) |
| **Min Risk** | Number | Input (number) | Minimum risk score (0-5) |
| **Max Risk** | Number | Input (number) | Maximum risk score (0-5) |
| **Statuses** | Multi-select | MultiSelect | Filter by status values |
| **Incident Types** | Multi-select | MultiSelect | Filter by incident types |
| **Violation Types** | Multi-select | MultiSelect | Filter by violation types |

### 3. **Charts with Filtering Applied**

All charts in the Overview section now support filtering:

✅ **Hazards Trend** - Line chart with date/department/severity/risk filters
✅ **Incidents Trend** - Line chart with date/department/severity/risk filters  
✅ **Incident Types** - Bar chart with all applicable filters
✅ **Root Cause Pareto** - Pareto chart with all applicable filters
✅ **Top Inspection Findings** - Bar chart with all applicable filters
✅ **Department × Month Heatmap** - Heatmap with all applicable filters

### 4. **Dynamic Filter Application**

- **Automatic updates**: Charts refresh automatically when filters change
- **Memoized params**: Filter parameters are computed efficiently using `useMemo`
- **Refresh key**: Manual refresh button triggers re-fetch of all data
- **Empty state handling**: Charts handle empty filtered results gracefully

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
// Filter states
const [startDate, setStartDate] = useState<string>("");
const [endDate, setEndDate] = useState<string>("");
const [departments, setDepartments] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [locations, setLocations] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [sublocations, setSublocations] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [minSeverity, setMinSeverity] = useState<string>("");
const [maxSeverity, setMaxSeverity] = useState<string>("");
const [minRisk, setMinRisk] = useState<string>("");
const [maxRisk, setMaxRisk] = useState<string>("");
const [statuses, setStatuses] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [incidentTypes, setIncidentTypes] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [violationTypes, setViolationTypes] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

### Filter Params Builder

```typescript
const filterParams = useMemo(() => {
  const params: Record<string, any> = {};
  if (startDate) params.start_date = startDate;
  if (endDate) params.end_date = endDate;
  if (departments.length > 0) params.departments = departments;
  if (locations.length > 0) params.locations = locations;
  if (sublocations.length > 0) params.sublocations = sublocations;
  if (minSeverity) params.min_severity = parseFloat(minSeverity);
  if (maxSeverity) params.max_severity = parseFloat(maxSeverity);
  if (minRisk) params.min_risk = parseFloat(minRisk);
  if (maxRisk) params.max_risk = parseFloat(maxRisk);
  if (statuses.length > 0) params.statuses = statuses;
  if (incidentTypes.length > 0) params.incident_types = incidentTypes;
  if (violationTypes.length > 0) params.violation_types = violationTypes;
  return params;
}, [startDate, endDate, departments, locations, sublocations, minSeverity, maxSeverity, minRisk, maxRisk, statuses, incidentTypes, violationTypes]);
```

### Chart Integration

```typescript
// Before
<ShadcnLineCard 
  title="Incidents Trend" 
  endpoint="/analytics/data/incident-trend" 
  params={{ dataset: "incident" }} 
/>

// After
<ShadcnLineCard 
  title="Incidents Trend" 
  endpoint="/analytics/data/incident-trend" 
  params={{ dataset: "incident", ...filterParams }} 
  refreshKey={refreshKey}
/>
```

## 📊 Filter Options (Configurable)

Current filter options are hardcoded but can be replaced with API calls:

```typescript
const departmentOptions = [
  { label: "Operations", value: "Operations" },
  { label: "Maintenance", value: "Maintenance" },
  { label: "Engineering", value: "Engineering" },
  { label: "Safety", value: "Safety" },
  { label: "Quality", value: "Quality" },
  { label: "Production", value: "Production" },
];
```

**Future Enhancement**: Fetch these from backend endpoints like:
- `GET /api/filters/departments`
- `GET /api/filters/locations`
- `GET /api/filters/statuses`

---

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. **Basic Filter Test**
```
1. Open Overview page
2. Click "Filters" button in header
3. Select a department (e.g., "Operations")
4. Verify all charts update with filtered data
5. Check that filter count badge shows "1"
```

### 2. **Date Range Test**
```
1. Set Start Date: 2024-01-01
2. Set End Date: 2024-06-30
3. Verify charts show only data from Q1-Q2 2024
```

### 3. **Multi-Filter Test**
```
1. Select multiple departments
2. Set min severity to 3
3. Set min risk to 4
4. Verify charts show only high-risk, high-severity incidents in selected departments
5. Check filter count badge shows "4"
```

### 4. **Clear Filters Test**
```
1. Apply multiple filters
2. Click "Clear All" button
3. Verify all filters reset to empty
4. Verify charts show all data again
```

---

## 🔗 Backend Integration

The filters are passed to backend endpoints as query parameters:

### Example API Call
```
GET /analytics/data/incident-trend?dataset=incident&start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-12-31&departments=Operations&departments=Maintenance&min_severity=3&min_risk=4
```

### Backend Filter Processing
According to your documentation, the backend uses:
- `app/services/filters.py` - `apply_analytics_filters()` function
- Supports all 13 filter parameters
- Returns filtered data for charts

---

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: High-Risk Incidents in Operations (Q1 2024)
```
Filters:
- Start Date: 2024-01-01
- End Date: 2024-03-31
- Departments: Operations
- Min Risk: 4
- Min Severity: 4

Result: Shows only severe, high-risk incidents in Operations for Q1
```

### Example 2: Open Issues Across Multiple Departments
```
Filters:
- Departments: Operations, Maintenance, Engineering
- Statuses: Open, In Progress

Result: Shows all open/in-progress incidents across 3 departments
```

### Example 3: Slip/Fall Incidents in Specific Location
```
Filters:
- Locations: Plant A
- Incident Types: Slip, Fall
- Start Date: 2024-01-01

Result: Shows slip and fall incidents at Plant A this year
```

- [ ] Add "Apply" button for batch filter changes
- [ ] Add filter validation with error messages

### Medium-term
- [ ] Save user filter preferences
- [ ] Export filtered data to CSV/Excel
- [ ] Add filter history/recent filters
- [ ] Add advanced filters (text search, regex)

### Long-term
- [ ] Filter recommendation engine
- [ ] Cross-page filter persistence
- [ ] Filter-based alerts and notifications
- [ ] Filter analytics (track most-used combinations)

---

## 📝 Notes

### Filter Options
The current filter options (departments, locations, etc.) are **hardcoded** in the component. In production, these should be fetched from backend endpoints to reflect actual data values.

### Backend Compatibility
The implementation follows the exact filter parameter names from your backend documentation:
- `start_date`, `end_date` (not `startDate`, `endDate`)
- `departments`, `locations` (arrays)
- `min_severity`, `max_severity`, `min_risk`, `max_risk` (floats)

### Performance
- Filters use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Charts have `refreshKey` prop for manual refresh control
- Multi-select components are optimized for large option lists
